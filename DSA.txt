1.Stack Memory and Heap Memory
all functions ,variable declarations,methods are will be in stack memory
This be deleted soon after the function or method is returned.
Each will be built ontop of each others and gets cleared once their job is done.
2.All the objects will be in heap memory and their reference alone will be in stack memory.
If the object is no  longer referenced that be removed from heap memomry.

That's the reason where if obj a is changed obj b is also changed in pass be reference.
And in pass by value the values remain independent.

pass by value:
int a = 100;
int b =a;//b=100
int b =200//b=200
int a value will be still 100

pass by reference:
car c1 = new car(Name = 'Toyota');
car c2 = c1; c2 car = 'Toyota'
car c2.Name = 'BMW'
car c1.Name will be also equal to BMW
since both are poitning to same object


Order 1: Irrespetcive of your input if it takes same time.Physical visit to get game
Order n: If the time taken multiplies th einput size (1 kb file;2min and 5kb file;10 mins)


Any algorithm ifcompared to another we use asymptotic algorithms
Super fastman solves in 5 seconds - Big O
Super slowman solved in 10 seconds- Big Omega
Average man solves in   7 seconds - Big Theta
