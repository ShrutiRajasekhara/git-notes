To know current directory - pwd
1.GIT bash is just a terminal
2.Let git know who you are by configuring

git config --global user.name "Shruti"
git config --global user.email "shrutisandeep@gmail.com"

Threestage architecture

snapshot is like capturing photo.
Say everything is working fine and you want to capture it,then take a snapshot.

If you want to move your changes to next commit,add them to staging area.

Working			 GitDirectory
Directory--->Staging---->(Repository)
(Untracked)

.git comprises of all compressed versions of all the commits.This is a hidden file.

1.To make any folder git repository use git init
2.git status
3.To move all files to staging.   git add --a
4.To commit the files.            git commit -m "message"
5.To know all the commits&details git log
6.To stage only what is required  git add first.txt
7.To stop any folder to be tracked rm -rf.git(Removing repository infact)
Which deletes the .git hidden file(Donot use in real time)
8.To clone repository             git clone pastelink foldername(optional)

I have staged files and after that If I edit,the ones staged earlier go and commit if we commit.Then stage it again for the 
file which is chnaged and then commit
9.To ignore files which shouldnot be tracked  touch .gitignore and add the name of the file which should be ignored
dir/->Ignores where ever the dir folder is present
However if files are already being tracked and added later in the .gitignore.They will be still tracked.
We have to let git explicilty know don't track this file which you were tracking earlier. git rm --cached filename(This will not be tracked.Untracked file) and then commit
Only outer to be ignored /dir/ (this just represents the path)
10.Blank folders will be ignored and not tracked
11.Compare between working directory and staging area git diff
12.Compare between current staging area and previous commit   git diff --stage
14.To commit changes without using staging area  git commit -a -m "Direct Commit"(Untracked files will not work here).
Atleast once thse should be staged earlier
15.To delete any files  git rm filename.This will be automatically staged and we just need to commit
16.To change the name of files. git mv oldfilename newfilename.This will be automatically staged and we just need to commit
17.To show the changes between commits git log -p 
18.To see last n commits along with diff git log -p -n
19.To see stats of commits in files      git log --stat
20.To see all the commits in one line    git log --pretty=oneline
21.To see all the commits in one line    git log --pretty=short
21.To see all the commits in one line    git log --pretty=full
22.TO see last 2 days/weeks commits      git log --since= 2 days/2weeks
22.TO see last 2 days/weeks commits      git log --pretty=format:%h --%an(check gitscm documentation)
23.To modify the latest commit           git commit --amend
24.To see last commit                    git show --summary
25.To unstage the file back from staging git restore --staged filename
To discard the modifications in working directory and match previous commit  use git restore filename
26.To match the content of working directory back to the previous commit git checkout --filename

27.Remote:Meaning something is hosting and we are going to work on that
git remote add origin https://github.com/ShrutiRajasekhara/DevCopado.git
git remote -v (gives you ftech and push).However we cannot push anything rite away because in that case any one can push anycode.
So generate ssh key
Step 01: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "shrutisandeep12@gmail.com"
Step 02: eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Step 03: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Step 04: tail ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Past in settings SSHKEY:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDBjK8nMxBvcuG7fQUaTy/uBr4oOKMmnfrXbmUbIQbZfl3ldCM/sNLJK8u1BZqs8FH3qb9u/RfMz5ZgbY01kWaF9F3Rq5c3y+uvqQe64ySJd5qOLKJ7iT693Cyg8S7b/39SCZDkQNAud2forKQxevbv14ThwQ6Z7do4UgdZRFGFDmWw60+c4Vgl7OmoJssEXVx9tf7FZ6nHbga6K8MH5m8oHKvcf2Frtv2nMy1/BvG1o0BNokrShMHroYyuUnOH+ufOa2ZMf1h+n53TMC+KN/2rKlQlD9KUMFzaiNUdIhpqQNzNgyqRlz13e/6Ibm0aGuDOwfxeNn408DwDk7Rq1lcEwW89e0A1n7y7BmZYVu9fVk9m1B1Q+7mzR02b3UtcZJGTWlgWqbs/qPYHLQ139RoJ7Lgm3H7bmvqwuwXT2ADByVlRozlGLaqF141XI0REdsPAKErNFyWU36itPBt1uXHa5s/KBMZ5LhwfJTdJhZwF7JL0kxO5BEgrioFxs09flq+nmlA7jkU0ODSdgKfZoy1eV9L1QqE6rj23CgJmzmAq8wwHBJ9Hlm4L2jmj1VMpP9X9WhO4rVznpE8XxKWVEwaKO9gERjHHfGD8M8L1W+LRF2l88skKdxvwjIE/MbuBsQQFLGm3qGnKgtO94yBig77KQx8nANTc4w/0THcqqlMANw== shrutirajasekhara@gmail.com
git push -u origin master
28.git config --global alias.st status
29.Creates branch and puts you there git checkout -b branchName 
   To switch the branch              git checkout  master
   To see all the branches	     git branch

30.When you have a repo already:
git remote add origin https://github.com/ShrutiRajasekhara/git-tutorials.git
$ git push -u origin master
31.git merge branchName
